Over the years, I've had the opportunity to expand my skills in programming trading algorithms, covering both cryptocurrencies and traditional finance. My work has focused on creating algorithms that use technical analyses such as RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD, and ATR. These tools have helped deepen my understanding of market dynamics while remaining attentive to risks and opportunities.

Among my projects, I worked on an algorithm for the Binance platform, which can be managed via Telegram. This approach aims to simplify trading management while staying responsive to market fluctuations. Concurrently, I've explored the use of C/C++ languages for trading on decentralized platforms like Uniswap, seeking to balance speed and efficiency.

I constantly strive to integrate control mechanisms into my algorithms, such as executing orders and canceling positions, to promote a more measured and sustainable trading approach. This attention to detail is crucial for navigating often unpredictable markets.

I have also taken initiatives to deploy these algorithms on the cloud using Docker, seeking solutions that combine flexibility and reliability. This is part of my ongoing commitment to learning and adapting in a constantly evolving field.

In summary, while I am passionate about developing trading algorithms and exploring new strategies, I remain aware of the importance of caution and continuous learning in this sector. Each project is an opportunity to learn and grow, while modestly contributing to the advancement of digital and traditional trading.
