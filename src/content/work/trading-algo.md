##### Advanced Trading Strategy in Cryptocurrencies
Over the past few years, I have developed a specialized trading strategy for cryptocurrencies, focusing primarily on automating technical analysis. This strategy is optimized to capitalize on market volatility, exploiting periods of moderate growth or decline. I use analysis tools like RSI and Bollinger Bands on various time scales to identify potential areas of price fluctuation, allowing for strategic positioning of buy and sell orders. My algorithm starts by collecting a month of historical data before starting to analyze the market in real time.

In addition to these tools, I work with other indicators such as MACD and ATR, and I am constantly looking for ways to refine and improve my strategy.

##### Binance API and Innovation Project
As part of my projects, I developed an algorithm for the Binance platform that can be controlled via Telegram. This tool aims to simplify trading management while remaining adaptive to market fluctuations. At the same time, I experimented with C/C++ languages ​​for trading on decentralized platforms such as Uniswap, seeking to find the right balance between speed and efficiency.

##### Security and Reliability of Algorithms
A constant priority in my work is to integrate rigorous controls into my algorithms. This includes secure order management and proactive position cancellation to ensure a prudent and sustainable trading approach. This meticulous attention is essential to effectively navigating markets that are often volatile and unpredictable.

##### Cloud Deployment and Adaptability
I took the initiative to deploy my algorithms on the cloud via Docker, looking for solutions that combine flexibility and robustness. This choice is part of my ongoing process of learning and adaptation in a constantly evolving sector.
