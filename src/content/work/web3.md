##### Custom NFT Development
With my experience in the NFT domain, I am able to guide you in creating your unique collection. Using sophisticated Node.js scripts and my deep knowledge of decentralized peer-to-peer storage, I customize every aspect of your project. This includes adjusting the rarity of your designs to generate samples that perfectly match your requirements. My expertise extends to the deployment of custom smart contracts, including advanced features such as post-mint reveal, thus ensuring a unique and secure experience for your users.

##### Creation and Integration of Dapps with React, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Truffle, Hardhat
I offer seamless blockchain integration for your web applications, using Metamask for an optimal user experience. Thanks to my mastery of APIs and a deep understanding of blockchain mechanisms, I am capable of developing efficient SWAP aggregators, ensuring peer-to-peer transactions at the best rates. My experience covers a wide range of EVM blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Lukso, and Arbitrum, allowing me to provide adapted and high-performing solutions in various blockchain environments.
