#### Expertise in Web Data Extraction Automation

##### Solutions adapted to each project
I have an advanced expertise in retrieving and structuring data from various web sources. My in-depth mastery of libraries such as Selenium, Requests, and Scrapy allows me to develop tailor-made solutions, perfectly suited to the specific needs of each project. I also integrate strategies to overcome scraping-related challenges, such as proxy rotation, VPN usage, cookie management, and user-agent customization, thus ensuring an efficient and discreet data collection.

##### Collect reliable data
My experience in data scraping extends to data accessible by a connection with identifiers. In my previous projects, I have designed systems that operate autonomously over long periods of time, ensuring continuous and flawless data collection. This reliability is essential for projects requiring monitoring of data collected over several months.

##### Automate your market research
Additionally, I offer specialized market research services for businesses seeking to understand their competitive positioning and identify market opportunities. Through good organization of information in SQL databases, I am able to provide valuable insights, in the form of dashboards, that help guide business strategies and make informed decisions based on reliable and reliable data. updated.
