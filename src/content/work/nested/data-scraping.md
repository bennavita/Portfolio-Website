#### Expertise in Web Data Extraction Automation

I have advanced expertise in retrieving and structuring data from various web sources. My in-depth knowledge of libraries such as Selenium, Requests and Scrapy allows me to develop tailor-made solutions, perfectly adapted to the specific needs of each project.

My experience in data scraping extends to data accessible by a connection with identifiers. In my previous projects, I have designed systems that operate autonomously over long periods of time, ensuring continuous and flawless data collection. This reliability is essential for projects requiring monitoring of data collected over several months.

Additionally, I offer specialized benchmark services for businesses seeking to understand their competitive positioning and identify market opportunities. Through good organization of information in SQL databases, I am able to provide valuable insights, in the form of dashboards, that help guide business strategies and make informed decisions based on updated data.
