#### Inform your decisions with Python

The tools Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn are at the heart of my approach to analyzing complex datasets, allowing me to transform large volumes of raw data into clear insights. My expertise is not limited to data manipulation; it also extends to creating data visualizations that are both aesthetic and functional.

#### I like puzzles
I am well aware that data analysis is a discipline where learning must be regular and I continue my learning to further integrate mathematics into my analyses.


- Here are some recently worked concepts:

1. Dijkstra's algorithm
2. Diophantine Equations
3. Sequences by induction
4. Hash tables

#### Specialized in financial data

My training and background as a pricing analyst have equipped me with a strong understanding of financial data. Interested in the world of cryptocurrencies, I am continually on the lookout for new performance indicators, always seeking to refine my analysis models to stay at the forefront in this rapidly evolving field.
