##### VBA as a productivity tool
Within large companies like Airbus and CNH Industrial, I often looked to see how I could optimize my working time.
I naturally turned to Excel macros to automate reports, send recurring emails and interact simultaneously with several Excel workbooks in order to gather the information necessary for certain calculations.

##### Example projects
My mastery of userForms and advanced VBA concepts allowed me to divide by 3 the time spent on certain tasks while guaranteeing better reliability of procedures.

For example, I designed an algorithm to automatically respond to price requests from dealers by taking maximum advantage of the information available to process the requests simultaneously. This way, I was able to guarantee faster processing of requests, responses adapted to the language of each market and more time to devote to other projects.

##### Cooperate more easily between services
I have also developed projects based on cooperation between several departments, as a solution to ensure that the sales figures communicated by Finance and Marketing are aligned.

##### Tailor-made solutions
