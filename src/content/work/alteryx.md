#### Alteryx for Data Analysis

##### Why Alteryx?

Alteryx allows you to manipulate data from multiple sources, from csv files to SQL databases. It is software with impressive performance that allows you to interact with data without having to code. It allows you to carry out analyzes in just a few minutes that would be impossible to carry out in Excel.

##### My Alteryx experience at CNH Industrial
Over the past two years, I have used Alteryx daily and have been fortunate to attend a series of specialized training courses. This allows me to quickly develop complex analysis solutions. For example, I carried out an analysis of pack quantities at the group level to help the Logistics department determine which packaging quantities are appropriate for the sales of each market. Thus we were able to offer quantities that corresponded to the requests of our dealers, while rationalizing our purchasing quantities in order to guarantee better costs. This analysis originally carried out on a family of parts was reused on other families thanks to the flexibility of Alteryx.

##### Integrate Alteryx into your processes
I can also integrate Alteryx results into Excel macros, thereby optimizing daily processes. This approach significantly reduces the time spent on recurring tasks, by streamlining data processing operations.
